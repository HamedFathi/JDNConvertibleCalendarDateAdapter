# JDNConvertibleCalendarDateAdapter

`JDNConvertibleCalendarDateAdapter` provides an implementation of Angular Material 2 `DateAdapter` for `JDNConvertibleCalendar``, 
so that the Angular Material 2 DatePicker UI can be used with different calendar formats.

*This software is still in an early state of development and the tests are still incomplete*

## Known Bugs

When switching the date using the arrow keys in the upper right, the calendar view below is not updated/refreshed, see <https://github.com/dhlab-basel/JDNConvertibleCalendarDateAdapter/issues/2>.
